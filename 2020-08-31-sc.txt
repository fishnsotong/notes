Wayne is ambitious. Are there any ways to tweak the game to make it easier for him?

Why do I want to get into Oxford?

Don't let some vague ideas that your 13-year-old self had to decide what I want to do in the future. Is this ambition mine? Or is it someone else's?

Insofar as what I think my life's purpose is, must I necessarily do these things?

Going to these schools, getting a prestigious education to these universities, will they serve my ends?

Directly, I'm sure it'll provide a good environment and a good network. Indirectly, I think it's also the boost in ego, the feeling that I can accomplish things on the scale of what I did in my childhood that really makes a difference. It may seem trivial, but I think signalling to myself that I can be successful is important.

Which leads me to another point. Why is success, in this form and shape, that important to me? Do I do this to make the world a better place? Do I do this for a stab at creating a abetter future for myself?
